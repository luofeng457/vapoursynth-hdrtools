Changes in Version HDRTools 0.10 (since 0.9)
-------------------------------------------
- Additional (adaptive) Transfer Functions
- Additional downsampling and upsampling filters
- Post deblocking
- Denoising (Wiener and separable)
- I/O improvements
- Various bug fixes relating to dynamic range and other issues
- Closed loop conversion
- MinMax filtering
- Chroma limit aware clipping
- Constant Luminance Support
- Distortion Computation improvements
- Integration of Ericsson's Luma "micrograding" (iterative closed loop conversion)
  process. Two different versions were implemented that utilize two different 
  initial positions. Both result in similar performance but have different complexity.
  Scheme could be vastly improved in terms of speed, especially using LUTs for TF
  computation.
